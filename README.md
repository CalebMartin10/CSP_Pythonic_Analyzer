# CSP_Pythonic_Analyzer
This tool takes the sample.txt file and creatse a report on how many words are within the text file, how many of those words are unique, how many are longer than 3 characters, and what the top five most used words are. It also creates seperate functions for each of these capabilities, allowing you to use them in other projects if need be.
To run this tool, download the .py file and the text file and run it through vscode (preffered method since you could change the target file).

I refactored the unpythonic_analyzer by renaming variables to more descriptive and meaningful names like word instead of word_item. I also included proper spacing between operaters and operands, and definitions between eachother. I also added a with statement so the accessing of the sample text is properly handled with a context manager. I also used a list comprehension to create the list of long_words so that I would not have to use a confusing nest of for statements. I also used the collection.counter object to count the number of times a word appeared in the sample text.
